# Profile
profile: |
  I am a postdoctoral researcher and urban planner with a Ph.D. in Architecture and Architectural Engineering from Seoul National University. My expertise includes data-driven urban analysis, geospatial modeling, and sustainable urban design, with particular interests in sustainable mobility, active aging, spatial welfare, and collaborative AI. Recently, I have been focusing on challenges in shrinking cities, such as vacant properties and urban revitalization, using innovative approaches like spatio-temporal analysis and participatory methods. As a lecturer at Seoul National University and the Korea National University of Heritage, I teach courses on urban architecture and GIS-based design, combining data science with urban planning to advance sustainable and equitable urban development.
