# Profile
profile: |
  I am an assistant research professor with a Ph.D. in Architecture from Seoul National University and a Visiting Researcher at the Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies, The University of Tokyo. My expertise spans data-driven urban analysis, geospatial modeling, and sustainable urban design, with particular interests in sustainable mobility, active aging, spatial welfare, and collaborative AI. My long-term vision is to leverage cutting-edge technologies like collaborative AI and spatial analytics to create more inclusive, livable, and resilient cities. Recently, I have been addressing challenges in shrinking cities, such as vacant properties and urban revitalization, through innovative approaches like spatio-temporal analysis and participatory methods. I am currently seeking international opportunities to apply my skills in urban analysis and sustainable design, and I welcome inquiries via email for collaboration or potential roles.
